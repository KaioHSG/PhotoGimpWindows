## How to install?

1. Install [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/downloads).
2. Download the [**`PhotoGIMP-Windows-Installer.bat`**](https://github.com/kaiohsg/photogimp-windows/releases/latest) and run.

You can change the GIMP version by editing the `.bat` file (`set "gimpVersion=2.10"` to `set "gimpVersion=3.0"`).

This is a fork of [PhotoGIMP](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP) by [Diolinux](https://github.com/Diolinux). I just made a simple installer for Windows.
